segevs.com - Just my personal website. 

It's only a static site, so I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), thought it stroke a good balance between easy to build and maintain, good structure and fast output and easy to add content by way of adding `.md` files.

If I decide to add dynamic pages I will go with either Angular 9/10+ or React.js.
