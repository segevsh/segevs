segevs.com - Just my personal website. 

So.... why [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)? I believe in using the right tool for the job. The site is planned to be fully static so I thought it will strike a nice balance between easy to build and maintain and great performance. Hugo supports good structure tests very well in speed tests. In case I decide to add content it is  easy to add pages in a form of `.md` files.

If I decide to add dynamic pages I will go with either Angular 9/10+ or React.js.

Comments are always welcomed
